			<p class="description-paragraph">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of GSS is is to bring object-oriented programming paradigms to CSS.  GSS borrows much of it's ideas from
			<a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a>, but seeks to be more radical.  GSS supports variables, much like LESS, and even uses the same syntax
			for them as LESS does, and, like LESS, any CSS is valid GSS.  However, the similarities really stop there syntactically.  The principals are the same,
			but the syntax used for them is a bit different.  GSS supports mixins, through the use of the <span class="keyword">mixin</span> keyword, which can be
			used as shorthand for one or more property definitions.  They can be parametric, allowing them to behave much like functions, or can inherits properties from 
			one or more other mixins.  A GSS user can <span class="keyword">import</span> GSS stylesheets into a stylesheet, allowing him to reference variables and mixins
			declared in the imported file, or you can <span class="keyword">inline</span> your other stylesheets, which just fetches the content of the other file and tosses
			it right into the file that referenced it.  There are also a list of helper functions that one can use, among them are ones like <span class="keyword">url</span>,
			<span class="keyword">rgb</span>, and <span class="keyword">mix</span>.  I don't know about you, but vendor prefixes always annoyed the shit out of me. GSS does
			away with this annoyance.  If you're not sure what vendor prefixes to use, or if you should use any, for a particular property, simply prefix the property name with 
			the "~" symbol (or as I call it, the "squiggly line").  The GSS->CSS compiler will check whether the given property needs to be prefixed, and if so, will insert that
			property into the compiled code <em>with</em> all necessary prefixes, and once without any at all.
